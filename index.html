<p>I have had a very succesful track career. An impressive stat is that I have only ever competed in a meet and not gotten a medal once. That meet was the one where I pulled my hamstring.I have two all state awards, and one state runner up award. I also used to play soccer. In my highschool years, both of my varsity years, I won both regional championships. I am now a collegiate athlete and run track here at Lewis, and hope to continue my achievements.</p>
